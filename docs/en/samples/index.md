Publish-Subscribe This demo is based on the classic publish-subscribe (Pub/Sub) design pattern, providing a lightweight and flexible cross-module communication solution that enables message passing without direct dependencies between modules. The core functions include event subscription ($on), message publishing ($emit), subscription cancellation ($off), and event existence judgment ($judge), supporting asynchronous communication needs in multiple scenarios. Whether it's collaboration between front-end components or linkage between plugin modules, efficient message passing can be achieved through simple calls, helping to simplify code dependencies and improve project maintainability. The code can be directly integrated into Vela quick app projects and is a practical reference for learning design patterns and solving cross-module communication problems.
