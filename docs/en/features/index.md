# Interface

The framework provides several interfaces for applications to call to achieve more functions, including the following types of interfaces:

  * Basic function interface: used to obtain application information, platform information, device information, etc.;
  * Data file interface: used to obtain remote data, upload and download files, local data storage, etc.;
  * System capability interface: used to call system capabilities, such as obtaining network status, adjusting screen brightness, etc.;
  * Media interface: used to play and operate media files, such as playing music files, etc.;

Each interface is called a feature, and each feature contains several APIs that implement specific functions.
