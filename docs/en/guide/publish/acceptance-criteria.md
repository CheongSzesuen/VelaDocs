# Acceptance Criteria

To continuously enhance the user experience of Vela Quick Apps, we are officially incorporating startup performance into the quality acceptance criteria: the First Meaningful Paint (FMP) time for the Quick App's home page should be ≤2000ms. We have also compiled a set of best practices for Quick Apps, including startup acceleration solutions and resource loading strategies. Developers can refer to: [Best Practices](</vela/quickapp/en/guide/best-practice/>) for targeted optimization.
