# Developer Materials

Developer materials refer to the various resources and tools provided by the Quick App Platform for developers. Currently, they include extended components, and in the future, will offer more support such as page templates, functional interfaces, development tools, etc. Every developer is welcome to contact us at [vela-appframework@xiaomi.com](<mailto:vela-appframework@xiaomi.com>) to share your needs or contribute your material resources, jointly promoting technological progress and innovation, and building a more prosperous Quick App ecosystem.

Extended components are essentially custom components written by developers. If other developers want to use extended components, they only need to copy the component folder from the project address into their own project directory and import it into the page for use via the `<import>` method. Meanwhile, extended components provide developers with rich property configurations and callback events.

This design approach of extended components ensures the page's management capabilities over components while preventing unnecessary coupling between the page and components. It helps developers better organize logic and code, enhancing the maintainability of the project.
